                        <p class="ten-margin">This was the first set of icons that we designed for the bottom
                            navigation bar (for the marvel mockup). In order, the icons represent

                        <p>Additionally, we felt that grouping the icons more logically would result in a more
                            intuitive experience. We thus grouped "conversations" and "profiles" together.
                            We also decided to keep the "featured stories" functionality separate, acting as a call
                            to action for the user to explore it. The icons now have text explanations and are also
                            highlighted in blue when a user is in the view represented by them.</p>

                        <p>The icons are now of the same size, and have been custom modified to
                            make them part of the same ‘family’.</div>

                            fine detail and clearly come from the same family. Changes in the nav bar also went
                            hand-in-hand with a title bar on the top of the screen, which also shows the user
                            which section of the app they are presently in.

                            from our application itself. In our user research, we had learned that breast
                            cancer patients. We thus re-designed the local stories view to include
                            personalized recommendations generated by our app. We
                            received much more positive feedback after this change and users said it was
                            much clearer what they need to do at this stage (in the Local Stories view).

                            “Coming Soon” is a handwritten font that conveys the feeling of “writing a
